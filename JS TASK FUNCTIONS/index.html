            }

            Output

            Hello! Have a nice day

            3.Return the sum of two integers passed as arguments to the function 

            sample Input

            10
            200

            Output

            210

            4.Write a function to return the average of two integers and log the result.

            The formula to calculate the average of two integers is, average = (a+b)/2

            Sample Input

            4
            2

            Output

            3

            5.Log the value returned by the function (greetWithName) by passing the given name 
            (personName) as an argument to it.

            Sample Input

            Aravindh Kumar

            Output

            Hi Aravindh Kumar

            6.Write a function expression convertMinutesToSeconds to convert the
            given (minutes) to seconds.

            sample Input

            7.Function `findLargest()` finds the largest of three number by using “>” and “&&” operator in JavaScript.

Print num1 is the largest if num1>num2 and num1>num3.
Print num2 is the largest if num2<num3.
Else print num3.

8.Function `findTriangleType()` finds the type of the triangle for given side values by using “==” and “&&” operator in JavaScript.

Print “Equilateral triangle.” if values for all side1, side2 and side3 are equal.
Print “Isosceles triangle.” if values for side1 is equal to side2 or side2 is equal to side3
Else “Scalene triangle.” since values of all sides are unequal.

9.Function `checkInRange()` finds if the given number is within the provided start and end range using >=, <= and && operators in JavaScript.

Print “Between the range” if num is between start and end values
Else Print “Outside the range” since num is outside start and end values.

Between the range
num 15
start 11
range 30

Outside the range
num   20
start   34
range  51

10.Function `evalNumbers()` prints the result after evaluating arithmetic operations between two numbers of addition, multiplication, division, and modulus in JavaScript.

Print result of num1+num2 if operation is “add”
Print result of num1-num2 if operation is “subtract”
Print result of num1*num2 if operation is “multiply”
Print result of num1/num2 if operation is “divide”
Print result of num1%num2 if operation is “modulus”
Else print “Invalid operation”


11.Function `checkLeapYear()` find if the given year is a leap year or not by using %, !=, && and || operators in JavaScript.

If year is divisble by 4 and not divisble by 100 then print “leap year”.
Or if year is divisible by 400 then print “leap year”.
Else print “not a leap year”.

12.Function `findGrade()` to find the grade of the student based on the input marks.

Print “S grade” if marks is between 90 and 100.
Print “A grade” if marks is between 80 and 90.
Print “B grade” if marks is between 70 and 80.
Print “C grade” if marks is between 60 and 70.
Print “D grade” if marks is between 50 and 60.
Print “E grade” if marks is between 40 and 50.
Print “Student has failed” if marks is between 0 and 40.
Else print “Invalid marks”.

13.Function `findDaysInMonth()` finds the number of days in a given month of a year.

If month is outside the range of 1 and 12 print “Invalid month”.
If month is equal to 2 ie, February print “29 days” if leap year else print “28 days” .
Else if month is equal to 4, 6, 9 or 11 print “30 days”.
Else print “31 days”.
Month : 2
Year : 2012

Output
